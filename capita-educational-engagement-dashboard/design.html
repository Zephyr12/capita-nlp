						<h2>Data Sources: Twitter And The Student Forum</h2>
						<p align="justify">
							The system requires a big amount of data to analyse, and the task of collecting
							this data is achieved by the data pipelines. For the current stage, we are using two separate data sources:
							Twitter posts and Forum posts from TSR (The Student Room).
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							The system uses a Python Tweepy to "generate" (yield) twitter posts that are related to subjects such as school,
							university or any educational institution. Once the system starts running, this component generates/yields tweets
							to the system in real time, as they are generated by Twitter Users.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							The TSR Source is also designed to fetch posts one-by-one to the rest of the system as it starts running.
							It is based on a Python programmed Crawler using the Scrapy framework. It is designed to head to The Student Room
							page of university topics, and then starts crawling for each university individually and generates all the topic posts
							one-by-one in order to be further stored and analysed.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							This component also contains the Facebook Source, but it is not fully effective as we require specific Facebook Token
							that can only be achieved by special requests from a big company. It is designed to run in the same way (fetch data pieces
							one-by-one to the system), but because of the current restriction, it is slower than desired.
						</p>

						<div><br></div>

						<h2>Data Analysis Pipeline</h2>
						<p align="justify">
							This component is designed to produce meaning for a piece of information.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							For the purpose of our project, it is based on complex algorithms implemented with specific Python Libraries such as
							NLTK (for Named-Entity Recogniser and Natural Language Processing) together with GENSIM for Topic Modelling.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							This component receives pieces of information (raw text such as twitter posts, forum posts or a facebook even description)
							and then performs the analysis on them, gaining relevant insight such as: concerned entity, what is the overall sentiment
							for the concerned entity considering the information in the text and also the main topics discussed in that piece of information.
						</p>

						<div><br></div>

						<h2>Data Storage with PostgreSQL</h2>
						<p align="justify">
							This component is responsible for storing the output produced by the Data Analysis Pipeline.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							This is the place where all the insight is gathered all together, and it keeps growing as the system receives more and more
							pieces of information to analyse. For every educational institution, it stores the gained output from the analysis, creating
							more and more accurate system knowledge relating that institution.
						</p>

						<div><br></div>
						
						<h2>API</h2>
						<p align="justify">
							This represents the final main component of our system that is going to be used by future developers.
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							As all the information is processed and stored, the system needs to provide a way to work with it. Thus, our API is
							a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of future development which access the presented
							features of our project.

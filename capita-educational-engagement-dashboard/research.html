							<h2>Data Mining Pipelines</h2>
							<p>The purpose of the data mining pipeline is to grant us access to social media data, in a useful and accessible format, that is reliably and periodically captured. It focuses on capturing a variety of social media education-related data that include information about specific educational institutions or people in the educational domain, from relevant social media platforms.</p>
							<p> Our information is updated daily. However the process can be done more often but it would be counter productive as it comes with unwanted risks: receiving more data than the system can process, which would result in a system failure.</p>
							<p>The three initial social media sources were <a href="#twitter-pipeline">Twitter</a>, <a href="#facebook-pipeline">Facebook</a> and MumsNet. Lack of content on MumsNet forum, forced us to switch to another source and hence, we chose <a href="#scrapy-pipeline">scraping The Student Room</a> - which required the same scraping technology. Morever, every source required us to consider a specific API to work with.</p><br>

								<h2 id="facebook-pipeline">Facebook SDK for Python</h2>
								<b><h3><font color="white">WHY FACEBOOK API?</font></h3></b>
								<p>
									In order to create a Facebook pipeline, we had a few options: either using the
									<a href="http://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Facebook provided SDK for Python</a>[1], or use other libraries that would ease the work with the API for the developers. Although using other libraries would have made our initial developing process more easy (achieving a working Facebook pipeline), it would have come with risks that we could not take such as unwanted and unknown specific bugs inside that library, as they are not meant to be used for scraping. Considering our system complexity and the fact that Data Pipeline is our initial component, we decided on using the Facebook provided API, despite its poor documentation
									and deprecated functionalities in time[2].</p>
								<br>
								<b><h3><font color="white">RAISED ISSUES</font></h3></b>
								<p>As we have specified the deprecated functionalities, we came to realise that Facebook did provide support for Public Feed API (which was our main request for scraping the desired information), but <b>they <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/public_feed/">restricted</a>the access to the Feed API back in 2015</b> - which left us wondering what solution is most appropriate in order to get the desired information from Facebook.</p>
									
								<b><h3><font color="white">SOLUTION</font></h3></b>
								<p>Even though we could not make use of the public feed of Facebook posts, we could still make <b>search query requests</b> to the Facebook API. As a result, we can have access to search events that are related to any UK Educational Institution. Thus, this pipeline is set up to yield event descriptions (together with other relevant information as concerned university, location, dates).</p>

								<b><h3><font color="white">WHY SCRAPY?</font></h3></b>
								<p>
									In order to store all the posts relating the Universities in UK that are found on The Student Room forum,
									we had two options:
									<a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>[3]
									or
									<a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									While BeautifulSoup is just a <b>library</b> for parsing html(and xml) style documents,
									Scrapy is a <b>full framework</b> for web crawling which provides the tools to manage every stage of web
									crawl - tools	that come with certain advantages. Some of these tools are:
									<ol>
										<li>
											Request manager: provides the speed of cuncurrency without needing to invest time in developing the
											concurrent architecture, as it is all done behind the scenes.
										</li>
										<li>
											Selectors: which are used to parse the HTML documents in order to find the bits that are needed to be
											parsed. (BeautifulSoup also does this).
										</li>
										<li>
											Pipelines: once the data is retrieved, it can be <b>passed through various pipelines</b>, which
											serves the purpose of our application.
										</li>
									</ol></p>
									<p>
										As a result, we decided that Scrapy will be not only easier to implement (which also brings the advantage
										of being <b>easier to debug and maintain</b>), but actually faster because of the way it handles cocunrrency.
									</p>
									<br>
									<b><h3><font color="white">RAISED ISSUES</font></h3></b>
									<p>
										Because of the way Scrapy works, even though it produced the desired output on it's own (yielding
										forum posts), it did not behave as expected when we tried to merge the pipelines.
										Scrapy runs more threads in order to be faster and more efficient, but in order to be able to send
										signals between these threads, it needs to run on the main one in order - which it didn't at the
										stage of merging the pipes.
									</p>
									<b><h3><font color="white">SOLUTION</font></h3></b>
									<p>
										Looked up the Source Code for Scrapy to understand how it starts its crawler and then modified the
										thread invocation.

										<b><h3><font color="white">WHY GENSIM?</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											<a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">Gensim</a>[5] is a free Python library designed for topic
											modelling. It presents a lot of advantages and seemed to be the most accessible technology
											for our purpose at this level. Some of the useful advantages for our system are:
											<ul>
												<li>Scalability: Gensim can process large, web-scale corpora, using incremental online training
													algorithms. There is no need for the whole input corpus to reside fully in RAM at any one time.
												</li>
													<li>It is Platform Independent: Being pure Python, gensim runs on Linux, Windows and OS X,
														as well as any other platform that supports Python and NumPy.
													</li>
													<li>
														Provides efficient implementations: The core algorithms in gensim use highly
														optimized math routines. Gensim also contains a distributed version of several algorithms,
														intended to speed up processing and retrieval on machine clusters.
													</li>
											</ul>
										</p>


										<br>
										<b><h3><font color="white">RAISED ISSUES</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											Because of the complexity of this advanced process, gensim lda models needed a lot of time
											and data for training - resources that were not available for the scale of our system.
										</p>
										<b><h3><font color="white">SOLUTION</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											We used Google's pre-trained word2vec corpus in order to achieve the necessary output from our system.

										<b><h3><font color="white">WHY NLTK?</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											Our options for language processing were <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> and
											<a href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a>[6]. The difference between these two technologies
											is that spaCy represents an Industrial-Strenght Natural Language Processing while NLTK is
											designed to be a good starting point in this area (students, researchers).
										</p>
										<p>
											Moreover, spaCy is faster at Word Tokenization and Part-Of-Speech Tagging, while NLTK is
											faster at Sentence Tokenization - the last one being our system scope. Thus, we considered
											that in our case it is would be the best decision to chose NLTK over spaCy as it provides
											more support and is faster in the area that are mostly concerned about.

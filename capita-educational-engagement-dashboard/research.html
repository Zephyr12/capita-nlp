							<h2>Data Mining Pipelines</h2>
							<p>
								The purpose of our data mining pipeline is to be able to have access to social
								media in a useful and accessible format that is reliably and periodically captured.
								This focuses on capturing a variety of social media data sources from relevant social media about education,
								capturing data about specific organisations and people in the education domain and reliably
								capturing this data periodically.
							</p>
							<p>
								We decided to update our information daily, but this process can be done more often. However, it would be counter
								productive and comes with unwanted risks: receiving more data than the system can process, which
								would result in a system failure.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The three main sources at the beginning were : Twitter, <a href="#facebook-pipeline">Facebook</a>, MumsNet and other domain-specific forums.
								Eventually, because of the lack of important content of MumsNet, we switched to <a href="#scrapy-pipeline">
								scraping The Student Room</a> instead -
								which required the same scraping technology. For every individual data source, we had to consider a specific
								API to work with.

										<b><h3><font color="white">WHY FACEBOOK API?</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											In order to create a Facebook pipeline, we had a few options: either using the
											<a href="http://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Facebook provided SDK for Python</a>,
											or use other libraries that try to make it easier for the developers to work with the API. We decided that using
											other libraries would make our initial developing process easy (achieving a working Facebook pipeline), but it would
											come with risks that we could not take such as unwanted and unknown specific bugs inside that library, as they are
											not meant to be used for scraping. Because our system is so complex and the Data Pipeline component is the first
											component of it, we thought that using the Facebook provided API is the best solution, despite it's poor documentation
											and deprecated functionalities in time.
										</p>
										<br>
										<b><h3><font color="white">RAISED ISSUES</font></h3></b>
										<p>
											As we have specified the deprecated functionalities, we came to realise that Facebook did provide support for
											Public Feed API (which was our main request for scraping the desired information), but <b>they
												<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/public_feed/">restricted</a> the access
												to the Feed API back in 2015</b> - which left us wondering what solution is most appropriate in order to get
												the desired information from Facebook.
											</p>
											<b><h3><font color="white">SOLUTION</font></h3></b>
											<p>
												Even though we could not make use of the public feed of Facebook posts, we could still make <b>search
													query requests</b> to the Facebook API. As a result, we can have access to search events that are
													related to any UK Educational Institution. Thus, this pipeline is set up to yield event descriptions
													(together with other relevant information as concerned university, location, dates).

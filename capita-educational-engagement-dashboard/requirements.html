								<h1>Project and Client Background</h1><br><br>
								<p><font color="white">Our client, CAPITA, creates software that enables education institutions to help students achieve their goals. The core aim of our project is to produce a system that automatically gathers and processes engagement information about schools and colleges, from many different sources, in a way that allows these institutions to improve the education they provide.</font></p>

					<h2>Requirements gathering</h2>
					<p align="justify">We consider that this is a core process for a smooth development of a complex system, hence, we carefuly
						paid attention that there won't be any future misunderstandings after this process is complete.
						It is essential for us to know exactly what our client aims to obtain from our services, reason for
						which this process took more than expected.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Our first contact with our client was through e-mail, when we got a brief explanation of the status of
						this project at the specific time and a small overview of the expected requirements. At that time, CAPITA
						had an experimental approach for this project. As they always want to improve their services, they need
						to constantly test and develop new technologies aimed for this.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Through that e-mail we met our main stakeholder - Scott Bell - and his first description of the project:
						a system that gathers data from social media platforms, analyses the data and produces some output that can be
						further used by the company. However, the description was as general as it sounded, so we had to set up a
						meeting to start negociating the specifications.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						We had a one hour face-to-face meeting that gave Scott the opportunity to walk us through the vision of this
						project. Hece, we had the chance to discuss possible solutions and technologies for achieving the desired output:
						a complete social-media perspective for every educational institution in UK.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After we had our meeting, we agreed that Scott will soon provide us a final document that will contain all
						the specifications - considering the debate that we had on the possible technologies. However, our client
						did not manage to provide us the document in a short period of time wich caused us a two-weeks delay. We
						consider that this was an important factor over our working progress, as we only had a general perspective
						over the project, but we could not start doing the needing research for the technologies that followed to be used.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After three weeks from the starting date of the project, we managed to obtain a final version of the Specification
						Document, which allowed us started working on the project.

						technologies, we are aware that even its current output might be used by some individuals: people from
						marketing teams or product managers that can make use of the current information for their future
						product-related decisions.
